We need your strong hand now #HappyBirthdayHarryTruman! We need your strong hand now   Oh, Bill! We really understand you ‚Äì it‚Äôs definitely hard to stay awake when that woman starts to speak.  Good morning, patriots! Let the Sun always shine upon our wonderful land. God bless America!  Our servicemen, both former and past, both dead and alive, deserve a much better attitude and care from the Gov't.  "Lock Her Up" float on a parade in Iowa celebrating a local Fire Department‚Äôs 100th anniversary.  Obama‚Äôs policy turned into a disaster and it‚Äôs not just stupid, but even dangerous for all of us to continue it.  Clinton will bring in more than 620K refugees. If she can, why doesn‚Äôt she want to shelter our vets first?  People want justice, people want Clinton to answer and pay for her lies.  Morning, patriots! Let us pray for Trump to win in November and America will start moving to greatness!  Our Future is in Our Hands, America!  Trump earned the endorsement of the whole military community and the open letter signed by 88 generals proves it.  Still believe all other 9999 Obama's refugees are innocent?  Our Saturday rally Florida Goes Trump was great! Thank you for your support, patriots!üá∫üá∏ #MAGA  That‚Äôs a sad truth by Donald Trump. We need our country back, we need its sovereignty to be restored and protected  Last Saturday Trump supporters noticed a CNN reporter and addressed him with a demand, chanting ‚ÄúTell the truth!‚Äùüá∫üá∏  Obama despises our military forces and disrespects our servicemen. The new POTUS must honor our soldiers and vets!  What is worse, leaving four citizens to die or lying to the whole nation about it? Guess both are unforgivable.  Hillary confirmed her plans to shut down all US coal mines saying ‚ÄúCoal miners will have to find other work‚Äù.  "Smth is going on with Hilary that I don't like, Donald on the other hand he speaks his mind and is straight frwrd"  If we don‚Äôt take our country back this year, our children will never see the country we all grew up in.  Clinton‚Äôs portrait was demonstrated among a gallery of killers during the Army presentation about insider threats.  Kaine was previously tied to Esam Omeish, the Muslim American Society (MAS), a radical Islamic organization.  This November will predetermine the Country‚Äôs future so we can‚Äôt let the elections be rigged again.  Obama didn‚Äôt manage take care of our soldiers and veterans. Let‚Äôs pray the next President will.  Just compare these two stages and you‚Äôll see who is really standing for America.  The VA is wasting the taxpayers money. They are a disgrace to our veterans, who are still dying in waiting lines.  Stricter punishments for violence and hatred against the police! Contribute to American security, vote Trump!  Bus Tour will start in June to petition the Justice Department to hold Clinton accountable  Khan uses his family tragedy to promote Sharia and open border, so he easily found a place in Clinton‚Äôs campaign.  He knew about a rise in violence, esp. among small Islamist groups, but continued doing his job until his last day.  God bless every hero who fought for America and made a contribution to the freedom of our nation!  We need a strong confident President to deal with all the problems we received from Obama‚Äôs failures.  Good morning, patriots! November is coming, and we all are coming closer to our chance to take our country back!  We can never forget 22 veterans killing themselves every day and we can‚Äôt forget 300,000 homeless heroes.  We're gathering this Saturday to celebrate Trump's victory! Support our nation's champion. Let's MAGA!   If only all Americans had respect to our servicemen! Obama‚Äôs administration definitely lacks it.  Our current Government must be replaced by those who really care about the people's rights. #2A  The inflow of illegals is increasing every year of lib presidency. It's an insult to our laws and a security threat  Our religion is under attack, our flags are taken down, and politicians try again and again to disarm every patriot  Good morning, patriots! Here‚Äôs a beautiful house of Trump supporters from PA. God bless America, have a good day!  126K helmets turned out to be defective. Such an irresponsible attitude to our soldiers‚Äô lives is unforgivable.  Luckily Obama‚Äôs ‚Äòapology years‚Äô are almost over, and that traitor won‚Äôt ever speak for the whole nation again.  Friendly reminder for #SickHillary in celebration of #InternationalLiteracyDay!  They fought for our freedom and they deserve peace. So sad that they have to fight for their rights at home.  That‚Äôs a good warning. We already know how Hillary "won" Democratic primaries: by bribes and ballot box stuffing.  Clinton believes that people dying in VA waiting lines are not a big deal and the whole VA scandal is ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù.  At least 50,000 homeless veterans are starving dying in the streets, but liberals want to invite 620,000 refugees.  School said that displaying flags could ‚Äúpotentially compromise the safety of all in attendance at a school event‚Äù.  Almost 8000 veterans kill themselves every year. The number of veterans suicides has increased since 2001 by 32%  Seeing a smiling old man who has spent his best years serving our country is like a blessing. God bless veterans!  This would be impossible without your support, Florida patriots! We will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! üá∫üá∏  Another traitor burned the American flag outside DNC, but seems like the karma exists after all...  @WOOKIE318 I hope you also pissed off when Clinton supporters mock Trump otherwise it would be juvenile &amp; typical childish leftist behavior Just a day after three law enforcement officers were killed in Baton Rouge, Hillary continued her anti-police agenda  God bless our soldiers! They are the elite of our nation and the guarantee of our freedom!  .@HillaryClinton Tell us more about Alt-Right being a racist ideology. #SundayFunday  Last week Trump released a 10-point plan to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs.  I wonder how flag-vandalizing ‚Äòprotesters‚Äô dare to call themselves Americans.  ‚ÄúTrump is everything Hillary Clinton is not he is blunt, direct and strong and speaks his mind and his heart.‚Äù  Hillary says Trump is the candidate of racists and neo-Nazis. Meanwhile this KKK leader donated $20K to her campaign  United Airlines pilot Michael Folk was suspended for tweeting about Hillary‚Äôs emails.  They‚Äôve spent money that could feed and shelter homeless veterans, the money that could be spent on healthcare.  The Confederate flag represents the rebel spirit, the spirit of freedom and Southerners definitely know it.  And we shall never give that right away! God bless the Second Amendment! #2A  Our heroes deserve only the best care and shelter and they must always be the first on benefit lists.  Trump spoke to the Veterans of Foreign Wars at their annual convention.  Robert Byrd recruited members to KKK. Dem libs are now the ones trying to raise the tension between races today.  Woods is survived by his wife and 3 sons Heroes Woods and Doherty gave their lives away protecting their compatriots  We can‚Äôt let Obama and Hillary make these 70 thousand workers become unemployed. We can do it and we must do it!  She‚Äôd better spend her time and money on her healthcare and leave the politics forever. #collapsinghillary  Libs keep on accusing Trump of racism and bigotry, but we all see thousands of African Americans supporting Trump!  Tyrone death was ‚Äúhandled with disrespect and negligence by both Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration.‚Äù  One year after inviting ‚Äúno upper limit‚Äù of migrants to Germany, Merkel has admitted she made mistakes.  Saucier was sentenced for making photos inside a submarine. 3 pictures are nothing comparing to her 30,000 emails.  Deporting Clinton is more than just a brilliant idea, it is a true dream we all want to come true!  Clinton supports all wars and conflicts in the Middle East and she won‚Äôt stop sending our boys to die in the sands.  Nixon has admitted that ppl don‚Äôt trust him and resigned. Clinton will never admit her mistakes or act with honor.  Looks like leftists are raising a wave of violence again. A 62-yo male was assaulted for wearing a Trump T-shirt.  Trump has become the last stand between the globalist Establishment and ordinary people. May God help Donald Trump!  Good morning, people, and hail to the Old Glory! America wouldn‚Äôt be itself without our beautiful flag.  A high well-guarded fence is seen well on these videos. Isn‚Äôt that another demonstration of our Dems' hypocrisy?  Our Future is in Your Hands, America! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  It was supposed to be his last assignment working security and surveillance for the CIA. #NeverForget  Benghazi survivor John Tiegen warns all Americans  Join the march in NYC  Lt. Col. Fred Flynn, a disabled veteran was asked to leave a courtroom because he was wearing his Army uniform.  More and more people don‚Äôt trust CNN, CBS and NBC, and people lose their interest to NYT and Washington Post.  After a small verbal confrontation with a Hillary supporter Garcia turned away and was attacked from behind.  Assange: Up to 100,000 pages of Clinton documents to come  Do you want to be represented by a woman who chokes on her own lies everytime she starts speaking? Secretary Clinton  These riots are the real threat to security. It‚Äôs terrible that Obama‚Äôs Administration approves these protests.  We urgently need a strong leader. We need Donald Trump to become the next President.  #AltRightMeans to love your country! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  We can‚Äôt give presidency to an irresponsible person who denies her mistakes and lies to the whole nation.  Good morning, fellow Americans! God bless our flag and every man and woman standing for it!  The immigration inflow must be filtered and all people threatening our security must never enter our country!  And on the other hand that shows they have nothing else to accuse Trump of.  The Second Amendment protects my life, my family, my freedom and my property. And nothing‚Äôs gonna change it! #2A  Were wondering why "often confused" Hillary haven't messed up at #CommanderInChiefForum? Earpiece! She was cheating!  They fought for our homeland, but they don‚Äôt have a home now. How can that even be possible?  Neither police officers nor relatives of victims of recent attacks on cops were invited to DNC.  When did we start to oppress our own Constitutional rights and the Christian foundation of our society? #1A  She doesn‚Äôt care about a national tragedy, is that even real we can have a POTUS with a low morality? #NeverForget  Our President, our Congress, our every single politician must always stand for American people!  Clinton‚Äôs indifference resulted in four deaths but even that hasn‚Äôt changed her attitude to American citizens lives  We must return these two important principles to America: praising our Lord and honoring our soldiers.  Our veterans must receive all the benefits they deserve, and they deserve only the best!  God bless our young men and women standing ready to protect America from every enemy.  Does Hillary have any recollection of asking "to bring super-predators to heel"? #ClintonsMemory #FlashbackFriday  IRS Commissioner referred congressional charges of corrupt Clinton Foundation.  God bless the Second Amendment! It's more than just a right to be armed: it is a right to be free and safe! #2A  We can confidently call Clinton the most irresponsible Secretary of State in the whole American History. #LockHerUp  #AtLeastWeCanAgreeOn Our Sheriffs know the situation with illegal alien inflow better than anyone else. #MAGA  Wikileaks reported that Hillary is tied to the French Lefarge ‚Äì an industrial giant accused of sponsoring ISIS.  Does Hillary have any recollection of her KKK mentor widely using the term "white n****rs"? #ClintonsMemory  Breaking a law is called a crime, and breaking the immigration law is still a crime.  She's ready to do anything to take our guns away, that‚Äôs 1 of 1000 reasons why we can‚Äôt let her become a president  Hillary Clinton is a threat to our soldiers, a threat to our peace and a threat to our security.  How can our politicians sleep calmly when thousands of our heroes are homeless and suffering? Support our veterans!  Clinton's image has dropped among all age groups but has fallen the most with young Americans.  #SometimesIWishYou know how Colin Powell referred to Bill Clinton in the recent #DNCleak. #DickingBimbos  Clinton believes it is ‚Äútime to move on‚Äù from the Benghazi. That time will come only when she gets her punishment.  Morning, fellow Americans! It is a true blessing to have another day living in our beloved country. God bless you.  Both Clinton and Obama are guilty. They didn‚Äôt send military assistance even though both knew about the situation.  Proof that Trump supporters are being under-sampled in polls. p11 of the latest Fox News Poll. #ThursdayThoughts  It is ‚ÄòBlack Votes Matter‚Äô, not black lives what really matters for her. She is even ready to support extremists.  It was an absolute disrespect to the victims' families to let Mateen stand if front line of Clinton supporters.  We are free people of America and our rights are given to us by God and Constitution.  Mr. Eastwood stands for the Second Amendment and cutting the Federal Government. #2A  Detected a voter fraud? Tell us about it! Call 888-486-8102 or take photo/video and send it to us. #ElectionDay‚Ä¶  If you so aware of our flaws, why u haven't fixed them? 2 terms wasn't enough to do that?  We have an immigration crisis but the Gov't wants to increase the inflow of criminals instead of closing the border  5-10 years later ‚Äì if we continue this policy, there would be no middle class at all: we‚Äôll all become the poor.  We need to secure our borders and make sure that deported illegals won‚Äôt come back. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  What‚Äôs wrong with those people? If we ever lose our flag, our God or our Constitution ‚Äì we lose America.  The parents of two American citizens killed in the Benghazi attack sued Clinton in federal court this Monday.  Here‚Äôs another liberals‚Äô attempt to attack American history.  Good morning, fellow Americans! Have a good day, God bless every American soul!  #SometimesIWishYou know how Colin Powell referred to Bill Clinton in the recent #DNCleak. #DickingBimbos  Join us to stop Hillary Clinton from entering the White House! #NeverHillary  We want to gather patriots in FL cities and march to unite America and support Trump!  700 inmates have been released from Gitmo and more than 200 have returned to the fight or are suspected of doing so  In Reno she mentioned ‚ÄúTell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are.‚Äù #AltRightMeans  Obama keeps on talking about how safe we are and declares we have no ISIS threat.   Charles Judge Jr and Jonathon Prins were killed trying to defend a woman from Mills in Chapin, SC.  Obama's pentagon is officially arming Al Qaeda, the very people that responsible for 9/11.   Join our event in Florida! It‚Äôs time for America to recover from eight years of Obama!  If we let four more years of this policy happen then we‚Äôll have no borders at all.  The fact you‚Äôll never have your birthday as a President is really a great reason to celebrate, Mr Obama! #Happy55th  We can‚Äôt let another Democrat win this presidency ‚Äì godless Clinton will ban our faith.  Good morning, patriots! Our beloved America will always remain the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave!  We owe our military heroes for their service. Their sacrifice is the price of our freedom!  Good morning, patriots! We all are so lucky to be a part of our nation and culture. God bless America!  Either Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI or she lied on a State Department form as she began her tenure as SecStateüëè  Happy birthday, USMC! When Trump enters the White House, our military forces will be respected by the Government ag‚Ä¶  He was a husband and father, an Air Force veteran, and a 10-year veteran of the Foreign Service. #NeverForget  Anthony Weiner couldn't even keep his dick pic from getting viral, what about classified info he had access to.  It was a peaceful event and we can say that all leftists‚Äô attempts to make violent protests and provocations failed  ‚ÄúWe are forever indebted to those who have given their lives that we might be free‚Äù ‚Äì Ronald Reagan.  Good morning, Americans! General election is getting closer. Let‚Äôs all unite and make America great again!  "The laws that forbid the carrying disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes"  The Gov't welcomes traitors burning American flags, but when it comes to the Southern heritage...  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to protect Christianity.
